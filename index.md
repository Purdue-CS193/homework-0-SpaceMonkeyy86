# Jack's First CS193 Homework

Favorite Things About CS193:

- They teach you about Linux! I already use exclusively Linux on my school computer and this class will provide me with the opportunity to show it off. Also, it's just cool.
- No exams! Personally I don't mind exams but hey, I'll take a free pass if I get one.
- Gives me a reason to walk across campus a second time on Tuesday. Otherwise, I would probably just stay in the dorm all day and become depressed :/
